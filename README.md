## Problem Statement
Water is one of the elements and the necessity that most major global to the daily life. Approximately 71% of the surface of the earth is covered by water. From that only 2.5% of the surface water such as the rivers and lakes are potabale. Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies that occur when pollutant are indirectly or directly discharge into water bodies without adequate treatment to remove the harmful sediments. The increasing contamination of freshwater systems with thousands of industrial and natural chemical compounds is one of the key environmental problems facing humanity worldwide.

## Context
Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions. The purpose of this research is to identify the water quality status of water bodies and classify the water quality based on Water Quality Index.

## The aim of this project is to find out which parameter influences the potability of water and to differentiate potable and non potable water using a Machine learning model.

## ML Algorithm
The maximum accuracy we got from the model - XGBoost Classifier - 70.34%

## Model Deployment
We used Streamlit to deploy the model
